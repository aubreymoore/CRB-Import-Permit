I am requesting a new permit to import live coconut rhinoceros beetles, Oryctes rhinoceros, into Guam. These beetles will be used in USDA-APHIS funded laboratory research aimed at developing biological control for this species.

I was granted permit P526P-11-01844 for this purpose (see attached document), but I unintentionally allowed this to lapse into oblivion after one shipment.

If the current application is approved, an improved custom-designed secure shipping container will be used (see attached document).

Thanks for your consideration.
